Continuous variables only?- 

Tuning Params-

File Size- 

Speed of Prediction- 




## Linear

Can be used for -  Regression

Scaling Required? - NO

Continuous variables only?- NO 

Tuning Params- 

File Size- SMALL

Speed of Prediction- FAST




## Ridge
Gives the highest valuaable explanatory feature.

Can be used for -  Regression

Scaling Required? - YES, scaling affects the size of the coefficients

Continuous variables only?- YES, 

Tuning Params- Alpha

File Size-  SMALL

## Lasso
Systematic way to remove explanatory variables

Can be used for -  Regression

Scaling Required? - YES, scaling affects the size of the coefficients

Continuous variables only?- YES, 

Tuning Params- Alpha

File Size-  SMALL

Speed of Prediction- FAST
