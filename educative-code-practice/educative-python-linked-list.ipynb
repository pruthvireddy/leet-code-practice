However, if none of the nodes from the first list is found in the second list, that means there is no intersection point.\n","\n","Although this works, it is not efficient.

If these addresses match, it means it is an intersection point. If they don’t match, move both pointers forward one step and compare their addresses. Repeat this process until an intersection point is found, or both of the lists are exhausted. How do we solve this problem if the lists are not of the same length?
