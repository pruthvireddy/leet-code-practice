We then iterate through the list starting from the 0th0th index till the middle of the list indexed as lst[length(list)/2]. So if the length of the given list is 10, the iterator variable i on line 4 in our solution would start from 0 and end at 10/2 = 510/2=5. Note that the starting index 0 in the example is inclusive, and the ending index 5 is exclusive. At each iteration, we first append the largest unappended element and then the smallest. So in the first iteration, i = 0 and lst[-(0+1)] = lst[-1] corresponds to the last element of the list, which is also the largest. So the largest element in the list is appended to result first, and then the current or element indexed by i is appended.

Let’s take an example list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The maximum element is 66, and if we increment it by 11, we get 77. If we were to apply the modulus 77 to, let’s say, the element at index 00, we would get the same element back, i.e., 11.\n","\n","The other important characteristic is that we can add multiples of 77 to the elements, and we will still get back the original values by applying the modulus operator.\n","\n","Let’s consider lst[0] as an example. In the max/min ordering, we need to store 66 at index 00 in the list, since that is the maximum value in the list. Multiply 66 with 77 and add lst[0] to it, we get 7 * 6 + 1 = 437∗6+1=43. For our last trick, when we apply 4343 modulo\\ 7modulo 7, we get back the original 11. At the same time, if we dividedivide 4343 by 77, we get back 66.\n","\n","We achieve this behavior with the following line of code,\n","\n","lst[i] += (lst[maxIdx] % maxElem) * maxElem\n","lst[maxIdx] is stored as a multiplier and lst[i] is stored as remainder. Taking the same example from above, in the list, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the maxElem is 6 + 1 = 76+1=7 and 4343 is stored at index 00. Once we have 4343, we can get the new element 66 using 43/743/7. Also, we can go back to the original element, 1, using the expression 43%7.\n","\n","Similarly, we use the following line of code for odd indexes,\n","\n","lst[i] += (lst[minIdx] % maxElem) * maxElem\n","Review the rest of the iterations below,\n","\n","This allows us to swap the numbers in place without using any extra space.
